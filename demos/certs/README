There is often a need to generate test certificates automatically using
a script. This is often a cause for confusion which can result in incorrect
CA certificates, obsolete V1 certificates or duplicate serial numbers.
The range of command line options can be daunting for a beginner.

This is a simple example of how to generate certificates automatically
using scripts. Example creates a root CA, a server certificate signed by
the root, an intermediate CA signed by the root and finally a client 
certificate signed by the intermediate CA.
